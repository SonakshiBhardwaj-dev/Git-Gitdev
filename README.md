uydvWhen your Azure DevOps Server, previously named Team Foundation Server (TFS), hosts multiple projects, you can manage them more efficiently by grouping them together and assigning the same resources to them. For example, you can group projects that have similar requirements or objectives, such as all projects that access a particular code base. You can then manage the group of team projects as an autonomous resource with its own user groups, server resources, and maintenance schedule.

A group of projects is called a project collection. When you install Azure DevOps Server, a default collection is created to contain all projects. When you create a collection, you specify the logical and physical resources that projects within that collection can use. All the artifacts and data that those projects use are stored in the single database of the collection.

The following illustration shows how databases for project collections are integrated with the logical architecture. When you create a project, you specify the collection which will store its data.

Example: possible location of collection databases

If you haven't been added as an Azure DevOps Server administrator, get added now.

You must be a member of the local Administrators group on the server where you want to open the console, and either a member of the Azure DevOps Server or Team Foundation Administrators group, or your Edit Server-Level Information permission must be set to Allow.

Sign in to the application-tier server, open the Administration Console, and open the Team Project Collections node.
